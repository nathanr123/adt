TMS320C6678 VPX Dual Application Debugger Tool


The Application Debug Tool (ADT) is intended to act as an interface between the end user and TMS board, 
to test the board’s functionality, to flash and debug the application, to forward the broadcast data packet to 
GUI for data analysis.

The ADT is composed of Frontend software and backend software. The frontend software is a GUI; frontend software
utilizes the backend software to access the board functionality. User integrates the board with few systems and
develops the application using TI’s code composer development environment to build their files and uses ADT to
dump the application.
